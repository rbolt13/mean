# mean

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of mean is to make a simple package that preforms a simple function such as a mean. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of regexcite from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rbolt13/mean")
      
``` 

## Usage

A fairly common task with data is to find a mean. That is what `mean::rmean()` does. 

```{r}
library(mean)
(x <- c(3,4,5))
rmean(x)
```
